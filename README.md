# mailstat

Command-line tool for analyzing an email inbox and producing various statistics.

# Gmail

Must create a dedicated app password for use with less-secure apps on Gmail.  Prefer the use of a shell tool to manage
passwords such as `pass` (https://www.passwordstore.org/).  The default shell command that mailstat uses is 
`pass show mailstat/<email>`.
